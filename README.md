# Simple Sphere Parkour Game
Simple Sphere Parkour Game is a game made only to teach my friend how to code / make games.
It was a fun experience while me and him could learn new stuff white testing the game.
Each of us made our own version of this game.
I was making things preparing for the lesson, then next day i was teaching him how to make simmilar things, and how he can cameout with any idea how to convert that specific task in to code.
Also in free time I polished my version of that game so it could be looking better and be more enjoyable to play.
